script: 
create table tbl_orders (
order_id integer,
order_date date
);
insert into tbl_orders
values (1,'2022-10-21'),(2,'2022-10-22'),
(3,'2022-10-25'),(4,'2022-10-25');

select * into tbl_orders_copy from  tbl_orders;

select * from tbl_orders;
insert into tbl_orders
values (5,'2022-10-26'),(6,'2022-10-26');
delete from tbl_orders where order_id=1;


Solution:-
select t1.order_id,'D' Flag from tbl_orders_copy t1 where not exists (select t2.order_id from tbl_orders t2 where t1.order_id=t2.order_id and t1.order_date = t2.order_date )
 union all
select t1.order_id,'I' Flag from tbl_orders t1 where not exists (select t2.order_id from tbl_orders_copy t2 where t1.order_id=t2.order_id and t1.order_date = t2.order_date )

2->
with cte as (
  select t1.order_id from tbl_orders_copy t1 join tbl_orders t2 on t1.order_id=t2.order_id and t1.order_date = t2.order_date ),
  cte2 as (
  select order_id,'D' Flag from 
  Tbl_orders_copy where order_id not in(select order_id from cte)),
  cte3 as (
  select t1.order_id from tbl_orders t1 join tbl_orders_copy t2 on t1.order_id=t2.order_id and t1.order_date = t2.order_date ),
    cte4 as (
  select order_id,'I' Flag from 
  Tbl_orders where order_id not in(select order_id from cte3))
  
  select * from cte2 
  union all
  select * from cte4

Output:-
order_id	Flag
1	         D
5	         I
6        	I
